The tricky bit is that this code might just work! But it's brittle and unrelated changes to the Runner or even your Game Project might break this code! Why?\n\nBitfield Constants\n\nWhen it comes to constants used as bit field flags you should use the Bitwise OR operation | instead of the Arithmetic Add operation +. If we were to consider fa_readonly as 0b0001 and fa_archive as 0b0010 and we added (0b0001 + 0b0010 = 0b0011) these two together we would get the same result as if we or'd the values (0b0001 | 0b0010 = 0b0011). However, if for some reason the value of fa_readonly changed to be 0b0011 with two set bits instead of one (perhaps it's a mask field, or represents two other values together) then we will suddenly end up with an incorrect value and our code will stop working. (0b0011 + 0b0001 = 0b0100, and 0b0011 | 0b0001 = 0b0011).\n\nMutating Asset IDs\n\nAssets such as Rooms, Sprites and Objects are assigned an ordinal index number when your game is compiled. Which means that each asset is given a unique number that increments by 1 from 0. This may lead you to believe that if you wanted to get the next or previous room, for example, you can simply add or subtract 1 from the current room. However, the order that the rooms are in is different from the asset ID, perhaps you created the rooms out of order and then rearranged them, perhaps the method by which the compiler determines the asset IDs changes. In either of these instances your code would break. Instead you should use functions provided by the Runner for these specific tasks."
