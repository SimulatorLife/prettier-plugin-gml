# Interface Segregation Audit

Date: 2024-11-22

## Objective
Survey the repository for TypeScript or JavaScript interface/type definitions with broad names (e.g., `*Service`, `*Manager`, `*Controller`) that expose many members and might violate the Interface Segregation Principle.

## Method
- Searched for interface declarations in the source tree:
  - `rg "interface" src`
- Searched for type aliases or Flow-style definitions referencing "type":
  - `rg "type" src`
- Looked for broad naming patterns across the repository:
  - `rg "Service"`
  - `rg "Manager"`
  - `rg "Controller"`
- Inspected `package.json` to confirm the project is authored in JavaScript (`"type": "module"`) with no TypeScript configuration.

## Findings
- The repository is entirely JavaScript-based. No TypeScript or Flow interface/type definitions are present.
- Searches for service/manager/controller identifiers returned no implementation contracts, only documentation references.
- Existing modules rely on plain objects and functions, none of which represent large, catch-all contracts suitable for Interface Segregation refactors.

## Conclusion
No oversized interfaces or type definitions were found. No refactors were performed. Should the codebase adopt TypeScript or introduce broad service-style abstractions in the future, re-running this audit is recommended.
