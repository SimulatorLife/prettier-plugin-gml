# Interface Segregation Audit

This follow-up task asked for oversized TypeScript or JavaScript interfaces with broad names (for example `*Service`, `*Manager`, or `*Controller`) so they could be split into smaller role-specific contracts. I reviewed the repository to find any such candidates.

## Search strategy

* Searched for TypeScript `interface` declarations and Flow-style `type` aliases across the source tree (`rg "^interface" -n src`, `rg "type .*=" -n src`).
* Scanned for JSDoc typedef blocks that declare object shapes (`rg "@typedef {object}" -n src`).
* Looked for identifiers containing "Service", "Manager", or "Controller" across project sources (`rg "Service" -n src`, etc.).
* Enumerated `.ts`/`.d.ts` files outside of dependencies to double-check for authored TypeScript definitions (`find . -path './node_modules' -prune -o -name '*.ts' -o -name '*.d.ts'`).

## Findings

These sweeps show that the project is almost entirely plain JavaScript without custom interface or type declarations. The only `@typedef` blocks describe small helper objects (for example comment nodes and the Feather metadata), and no authored TypeScript `.ts` or `.d.ts` files exist. Occurrences of words like "Manager" or "Service" are limited to fixture content and third-party dependencies inside `node_modules/`.

Because there are no broad catch-all interfaces in the maintained source, there is nothing to split while staying within the repository's authored code. If future work introduces such contracts, rerunning the searches above will quickly identify them.
