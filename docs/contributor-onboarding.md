# Contributor onboarding

Use this checklist the first time you contribute to the repository or when
refreshing a workstation. It complements the Quick start guidance in
[the root README](../README.md#quick-start) with contributor-focused validation
checks.

## 1. Confirm prerequisites

1. Install **Node.js 25.0.0 or newer**. The workspace ships an `.nvmrc`; run
   `nvm install` followed by `nvm use` so local tooling matches CI.
2. Ensure pnpm is available. Confirm versions with `node -v` and `pnpm -v`.
3. Optional but recommended: install [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/)
   Git hooks by keeping `HUSKY` unset. Set `HUSKY=0` to bypass the hooks (for
   example, in ad-hoc CI jobs).

## 2. Install dependencies

```bash
nvm use
pnpm install
```

`pnpm install` installs the exact dependency graph captured in `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
Use `pnpm install` only after verifying the lockfile is current.

## 3. Validate the workspace

Run the aggregated checks before opening a pull request:

```bash
pnpm run check
```

`pnpm run check` runs the formatter audit, CI-mode lint, and the full Node.js test
suite. Re-run targeted suites when you touch scoped areas:

```bash
pnpm run test:parser
pnpm run test:plugin
pnpm run test:semantic
pnpm run test:cli
pnpm run lint
pnpm run format:check
```

Fixtures under `src/plugin/test/` and `src/parser/test/input/` are golden—do not
edit them unless you are intentionally changing formatter or parser output.

## 4. Sanity-check the formatter

Use these commands to verify the formatter wiring before experimenting on a
GameMaker project:

```bash
pnpm run format:gml -- --help
pnpm run format:gml -- --check
pnpm run cli -- --help
```

The `format:gml` workspace script now pins the `format` subcommand so the help
output spotlights formatter-specific flags. Pair it with the
[CLI wrapper reference](../README.md#cli-wrapper-environment-knobs) when
scripting automation, and fall back to `pnpm run cli -- --help` for the global
command inventory.

When you're ready to try the wrapper against a project, provide the target
directory explicitly so the command has GameMaker sources to process:

```bash
pnpm run format:gml -- path/to/project
```

## 5. Explore supporting documentation

* Start with the [documentation index](README.md) for deep dives and planning
  notes.
* Review the [semantic subsystem reference](../src/semantic/README.md) before
  adjusting identifier-case discovery or project-index caching.
* Keep the archived [legacy identifier-case plan](legacy-identifier-case-plan.md)
  available when enabling renames in a project to understand the historical
  safeguards and rollout steps.

Check back with this document when you swap machines or return from a long break
to stay aligned with the latest workflow expectations.
