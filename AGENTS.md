# Agent Instructions

- The existing test input and output fixtures (src/plugin/tests) in this project are considered golden files and **MUST NOT BE MODIFIED**. They capture the desired formatting for GML and must be preserved byte-for-byte. NEVER update or change these files, certainly not to "fix" a test failure unless explicitly instructed to do so.
- You may add new tests or adjust the way tests are executed, but do not change or replace the current input/output text fixtures.
