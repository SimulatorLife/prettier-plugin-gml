# Agent Instructions

- The existing test input and output fixtures (src/plugin/tests) in this project are considered golden files and **must not be modified**. They capture the desired formatting for GML and must be preserved byte-for-byte.
- You may add new tests or adjust the way tests are executed, but do not change or replace the current input/output text fixtures.
