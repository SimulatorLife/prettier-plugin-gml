// Orthogonalize the P2 direction to the vector from P1 to P3

/* 
 * The idea behind the algorithm is to imagine a sphere placed at P1 with radius of the first bone, and
 * another sphere at P3 with the radius of the second bone. The intersection between these spheres is a
 * circle representing all the possible placements of P2.
 * The first step is to find the middle point of this circle, and the radius of this intersection circle
