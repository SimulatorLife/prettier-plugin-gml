 * - Ensure consistency across different parts of the formatter
 * - Make it easier to maintain and update defaults
 * - Provide a single source of truth for configuration values
 * - Enable clearer understanding of formatting behavior
 *
 * Constants here focus on non-language concerns like formatting parameters,
 * thresholds, and limits. Language syntax and semantics are defined by GameMaker
 * and should not be made configurable.

 * - Accommodates modern wide displays
 * - Balances readability with information density
 * - Aligns with common GameMaker code conventions
 * - Works well with typical IDE and editor configurations
