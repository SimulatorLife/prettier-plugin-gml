# Format Test Fixtures

The fixture files in this directory represent the **target state** and **expected behavior** of the formatter.

Treat these as **golden fixtures**:

- Do **not** edit fixture `.gml` content to make failing tests pass.
- Do **not** disable, skip, or weaken tests that assert fixture behavior.
- Do **not** 're-generate' fixture expectations to match formatter behavior; always update the formatter's logic to match the fixture expectations.
- Update formatter logic and tests first, then regenerate/adjust fixture expectations only when intentionally changing expected behavior.

This directory follows a test-driven workflow: fixtures document what the formatter should do, and implementation must conform to that expected result.
