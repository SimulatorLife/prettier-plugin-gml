/**
 * Printer utilities for variable declarator layout in the GML formatter.
 *
 * This module is responsible for formatter-owned doc-layout operations:
 *
 * - Joining an array of declarator doc fragments with ", " separators
 *   for `VariableDeclaration` nodes in the printer.
 *
 * Path traversal helpers (e.g. `findEnclosingFunctionDeclaration`) have been
 * moved to `path-utils.ts`, which is the canonical home for AstPath utilities.
 *
 * All semantic/content rewrites (parameter renaming from `@function` tags,
 * filtering redundant `argument0`-style alias declarations) belong in
 * `@gmloop/lint`, not in the formatter. See target-state.md §2.2 and §3.2.
 *
 * ## Enforced Boundary — `filterMisattachedFunctionDocComments` was removed
 *
 * A function previously named `filterMisattachedFunctionDocComments` was
 * deleted from this module. It was a parser-workaround that repaired
 * misattached `@function`/`@func` doc-comment attachments directly inside the
 * formatter. Normalizing comment-to-node attachment is the parser's
 * responsibility (see `normalize-function-doc-comment-attachments.ts` in
 * `@gmloop/core`). The formatter must never attempt to repair AST
 * comment attachment—if the parser delivers misattached comments, the
 * parser pass must fix them upstream. (target-state.md §2.2, §3.2)
 *
 * Exported symbols are consumed by the printer (`print.ts`). All other symbols
 * in this file are module-private helpers.
