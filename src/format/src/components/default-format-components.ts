 * The contract now only exposes the helpers that the high-level Prettier
 * plugin wiring needs: the parser adapter, the printer entry point, the
 * `printComment`/`handleComments` Prettier callbacks, and the
 * `LogicalOperatorsStyle` map. The printer workspace imports the
 * remaining comment helpers (`printDanglingComments`,
 * `printDanglingCommentsAsGroup`) directly from
 * `../comments/comment-printer.js`; the previous
 * `printer/comment-print-boundary.ts` read-side indirection through
 * `options.gml` was a backward-compatibility shim with no remaining
 * callers and has been removed.
 * (target-state.md §2.3, §3.2)
 *
 * Adapter selection is delegated to {@link defaultGmlFormatAdapterResolver}
 * so this orchestration module never imports concrete low-level adapters
 * directly. The resolver contract is the single dependency-inversion seam
 * for the format workspace's high-level glue.
