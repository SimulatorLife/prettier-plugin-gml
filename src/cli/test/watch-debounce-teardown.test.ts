/**
 * Resource-leak regression test: debounced handler teardown during SIGTERM shutdown.
 *
 * **The leak**:
 * When `runWatchCommand` receives SIGTERM (or SIGINT) without an external AbortSignal, the
 * `cleanup()` function previously called `debouncedHandler.flush()` on every pending handler.
 * `flush()` invokes the callback immediately after the watcher is already closed. Because no
 * AbortSignal is present in that code path, `readSourceFileWithTransientEmptyRetry()` runs
 * unguarded and — when it encounters a transiently-empty file — creates a new `setTimeout`
 * timer via `delayFileReadRetry(25 ms, undefined)`. That timer has no cancellation mechanism
 * and outlives the cleanup phase, keeping the event loop alive and constituting a
 * resource leak.
 *
 * **The fix**:
 * `debouncedHandler.cancel()` is used instead of `flush()`, which discards the pending
 * debounced args and clears the underlying timer without invoking the callback.
 *
 * **Follow-up considerations**:
 * - All other callers of `DebouncedFunction.flush()` in this codebase should be audited to
 *   confirm they intend to execute (not discard) pending work.
 * - If "drain before shutdown" semantics are ever desired, they should be implemented
 *   explicitly and only after the watcher is still open — not after `watcher.close()`.
 * - The SIGTERM path currently exits via `process.exit(exitCode)` after cleanup; a future
 *   improvement would propagate an internal AbortSignal through the entire pipeline so that
 *   the abort-signal guard in `readSourceFileWithTransientEmptyRetry` provides defense-in-
 *   depth even when triggered from the SIGTERM/SIGINT path.
