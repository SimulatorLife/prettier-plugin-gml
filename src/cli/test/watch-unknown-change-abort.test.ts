/**
 * Resource-leak regression test: unknown-filename scan abort during SIGTERM shutdown.
 *
 * **The leak**:
 * When a file system event fires with `filename === null` (an "unknown" event, common on
 * macOS and during high-churn periods), the watch command calls `scheduleUnknownFileChanges`
 * directly (no debounce when `debounceDelay === 0`, or via a debounced callback). Inside that
 * async call chain, `handleFileChange` is called for every discovered GML file. If a file is
 * transiently empty at read time, `readSourceFileWithTransientEmptyRetry` calls
 * `delayFileReadRetry(N, signal?)` to schedule a retry via `setTimeout`.
 *
 * Previously, no `AbortSignal` was threaded into `scheduleUnknownFileChanges` or its callees.
 * When SIGTERM fired and cleanup ran, debounced handlers were cancelled but any in-flight
 * unknown scan continued unguarded. If the file read happened after cleanup started, the
 * timer created by `delayFileReadRetry(N, undefined)` had no cancellation mechanism and
 * outlived the cleanup phase — a resource leak that keeps the event loop alive.
 *
 * **The fix**:
 * An internal `AbortController` (`internalAbortController`) is created in `runWatchCommand`
 * and is aborted as the very first action in `cleanup()`. Its signal is passed through
 * `scheduleUnknownFileChanges` → `processQueuedUnknownFileChanges` →
 * `handleUnknownFileChanges` → `handleFileChange` → `readSourceFileWithTransientEmptyRetry`
 * → `delayFileReadRetry`. When the scan encounters a transiently-empty file after cleanup
 * has started, `delayFileReadRetry` detects that the signal is already aborted and returns
 * `false` immediately without creating a `setTimeout` timer.
 *
 * **Test strategy**:
 * The watcher callback, file reads, and directory scans are all asynchronous. When the
 * watcher callback fires synchronously (via the mock factory), the actual I/O work is queued
 * on the microtask/macrotask queues and runs **after** the current synchronous block
 * completes. This means:
 *   1. `void triggerUnknown()` is called — async chain queued but not yet started.
 *   2. `cleanupPhaseActive = true` is set synchronously.
 *   3. `process.emit("SIGTERM")` fires — `cleanup()` runs synchronously (in its sync part),
 *      aborting `internalAbortController` before the I/O work begins.
 *   4. The async scan eventually runs, but `delayFileReadRetry` now sees an already-aborted
 *      signal and returns `false` without calling `setTimeout(_, 25)`.
 *
 * The test intercepts `setTimeout` to detect any 25 ms retry timers created after the
 * cleanup phase starts. A count of 0 confirms the fix; a positive count indicates the leak.
