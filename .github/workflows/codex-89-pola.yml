      pr_body: >
        Seed PR for Codex to reconcile option documentation and inline comments
        with the behaviours the formatter actually ships.
      prompt: >
        Hunt for places where our documentation, option descriptions, or inline
        comments promise one behaviour but the implementation does something
        subtly different (for example "0 disables" while the code coerces the
        value to `null`). Choose one concrete contradiction that would surprise
        a player or contributor, then either bring the implementation back in
        line with the documented contract or tighten the docs so the behaviour
        is explicit. When tweaking text, keep the tone consistent with nearby
        guidance and call out the change in the PR body so reviewers can weigh
        whether future code should follow the clarified rule.
