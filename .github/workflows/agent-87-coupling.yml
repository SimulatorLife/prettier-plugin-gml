      pr_body: |
        Seed PR for Agent to reduce deep peer coupling by replacing fragile deep imports
        with stable abstractions and dependency boundaries.
      prompt: >
        Audit the repository for modules that import peers using deep relative paths
        ("../.." or deeper) or paths containing "/internal/" segments. For each finding,
        cite the file and import statement, explain why the coupling is risky, and
        recommend an appropriate abstraction (interface, adapter, factory, or public
        facade) that would let the consumer depend on stable contracts rather than
        implementation details. Prefer dependency injection or other boundary-enforcing
        patterns so callers receive collaborators via constructors or parameters instead
        of reaching into internal modules. Where improvements are tractable, implement
        the minimal changes needed to introduce the abstraction, update imports, and
        keep behaviour identical. Run formatters, linters, and relevant tests before
        finishing, and document any follow-up work if a larger refactor is required.
