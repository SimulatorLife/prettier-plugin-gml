        Seed PR for Codex to remove brittle collaborator type checks and reinforce
        Liskov Substitution Principle expectations.

        ### Acceptable substitution checks
        - Probe for required capabilities by verifying the presence of a method or
          property before use (e.g., `typeof transport.send === "function"`).
        - Feature-detect optional behaviour (flags, version markers) instead of
          comparing constructor names or prototypes.
        - Guard result shape by routing collaborators through a shared adapter or
          contract test that normalizes outputs.
      prompt: >
        Search for explicit type discrimination against collaborators that are meant
        to be polymorphic—such as `instanceof` checks, constructor name comparisons,
        or hard-coded property assertions prior to dispatch. Replace those checks with
        contract-driven solutions: introduce adapters, interface shims, or capability
        probes that normalize collaborator inputs/outputs so any substitute behaves
        consistently. Update call sites to depend on the shared contract, add light
        tests or documentation as needed, and describe how the refactor improves
        substitution safety.
