        Find one long-running or slow test (or suite segment), identify the primary
        time sinks, and refactor to reduce runtime without weakening coverage. Prefer
        smaller fixtures, more focused assertions, and removing unnecessary I/O or
        process startup. If setup/teardown dominates, streamline it or share fixtures
        safely. Include a brief before/after timing or clear reasoning, keep scope tight,
        and ensure the tests remain deterministic. Include the runtime improvements in 
        the PR description and/or commit message.
