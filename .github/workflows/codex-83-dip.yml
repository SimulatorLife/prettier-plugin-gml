        Seed PR for Codex to eliminate dependency-inversion violations where high-level modules
        reach for concrete adapters or construct their own dependencies.
      prompt: >
        Audit the high-level orchestration layers first: src/plugin/src/gml.js, the CLI entry
        point in src/cli/prettier-wrapper.js, and related glue modules that compose parser,
        printer, comment, or identifier-case subsystems. Search these files for the `new`
        keyword and for imports that pull concrete adapters from directories such as
        src/plugin/src/parsers/, src/plugin/src/printer/, or other low-level adapters. When you
        find a high-level module instantiating or importing a concrete implementation directly,
        treat it as a dependency inversion violation. Recommend (and implement when feasible)
        the right abstraction boundary by introducing interfaces, a provider registry, or
        constructor injection so the high-level code depends on abstractions instead of concrete
        adapters. Keep the refactor narrow and behaviour-preserving, update tests and docs as
        needed, and leave notes in the PR when follow-up work is required.
