      extra_context: >
        Connect the CLI watch pipeline, transpiler, and runtime wrapper into a working hot reload loop.
        Focus on wiring event flow, incremental transpilation, runtime patch delivery, and the developer
        experience needed to test it end-to-end. Keep changes incremental, add targeted tests, and align
        with the live reloading concept docs.
