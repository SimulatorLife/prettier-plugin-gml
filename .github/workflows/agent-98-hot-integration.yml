      component: "hot reload integration loop"
      extra_context: >
        Connect the CLI watch pipeline, transpiler, and runtime wrapper into a working hot-reload loop with an explicit priority on end-to-end latency, throughput, and minimal runtime overhead. Every change must be as performant or more performant than the previous state, with the hot-reload loop remaining as lightweight and responsive as possible.
        Focus on wiring event flow, incremental transpilation, and runtime patch delivery paths that are strictly necessary to achieve fast reloads, avoiding orchestration layers, abstractions, or developer-facing features that increase steady-state cost or reload latency. Prefer designs that delegate work to existing filesystem watchers, the 
        JavaScript/HTML5 runtime, and browser-native mechanisms rather than re-implementing them. Keep changes incremental, add targeted, low-cost end-to-end tests that validate the hot-reload loop without significantly slowing iteration, and ensure alignment with the live-reloading concept documentation.
