      prompt: >
        Scan the repository for unused functions, variables, files, assets, or
        configuration entries. Remove or archive one meaningful set of unused items,
        consolidating duplicates if needed. Keep the change tight and non-disruptive,
        verifying that no active features depend on what is removed so the codebase
        remains lean and purposeful. Double-check that any suspected dead code is not
        part of an in-flight feature or recently introduced capability that still needs
        to land before removal.
