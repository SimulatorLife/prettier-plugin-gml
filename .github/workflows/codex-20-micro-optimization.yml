      prompt: >
        Identify and optimize one specific micro-hot path (a tight loop, inner
        render/update step, or small utility on a critical code path) and deliver at
        least one measurable, behavior-preserving micro-optimization. You may not
        respond with “no issues found”—if no obvious optimization exists, choose the
        most plausible hotspot and apply a singular, safe, minimal improvement. Keep the
        blast radius tiny: no architectural rewrites, no API/interface changes, no new
        dependencies. Prefer straightforward optimizations such as reducing allocations,
        tightening iteration, avoiding repeated lookups inside loops, hoisting
        constants, caching small computed values, replacing polymorphic branches with
        predictable ones, simplifying data shapes, reducing string concatenations/JSON
        operations, collapsing nested conditionals into guard clauses, or
        short-circuiting common cases. In your commit message, include a small
        before/after measurement (micro-benchmark, timing probe, or deterministic
        counter) to show impact. Ensure the diff is small, readable, and well-commented;
        never sacrifice clarity for cleverness.
