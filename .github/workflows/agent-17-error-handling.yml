      prompt: >
        Review the codebase and pinpoint an area where error handling is inconsistent,
        ad-hoc, or missing. Refactor that area to align with a consistent project-wide
        pattern—whether through standardized logging, safe fallbacks, or structured
        error reporting—so issues are easier to diagnose and handle without unnecessary
        complexity.
