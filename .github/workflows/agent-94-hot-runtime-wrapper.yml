        Drive incremental improvements to the browser-side hot reload wrapper: WebSocket patch
        handling, registry lifecycle management, instrumentation, or integration tests that
        exercise patch application. Keep changes decoupled from the transpiler while ensuring
        the hooks line up with the live reloading concept document.
