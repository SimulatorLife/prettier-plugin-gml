      pr_body: >
        Seed PR for Agent to migrate a deprecated or legacy API to its supported
        successor while preserving behaviour.
      prompt: >
        Detect a call site using a deprecated library/API or internal module
        slated for removal. Replace it with the recommended modern equivalent,
        adjusting surrounding code as needed. Update inline docs or comments to
        reflect the new API, and add regression coverage or manual validation
        notes proving behaviour parity. Limit the scope to one meaningful
        migration so the diff stays focused.
