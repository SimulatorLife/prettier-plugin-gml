      pr_body: |
        ## Summary
        * Identify formatter modules where policy heuristics are intertwined with operational logic.
        * Extract policy evaluators or strategy objects so that formatting actions can delegate to them.

        ## Testing
        * npm test
      prompt: >
        Inspect modules where policy decisions (flags, thresholds, cache sizing, heuristic lookups, or other
        conditional rules) are implemented in the same place that performs operational side effects. Look for
        code that both decides "what" should happen and immediately carries out the "how", leaving no seam to
        exercise the policy independently.

        For one of these hotspots, design and implement a refactor that extracts the policy computation into a
        dedicated evaluator, ruleset, or strategy object. Adjust the mechanism code to depend on the extracted
        policy rather than recomputing heuristics inline. Ensure the new abstraction keeps existing behaviour
        intact, adds focused unit coverage where practical, and documents the separation so future contributors
        keep policy and mechanisms decoupled.
