        Search for explicit type discrimination against collaborators that are meant
        to be polymorphic—such as `instanceof` checks, constructor name comparisons,
        or hard-coded property assertions prior to dispatch. Replace those checks with
        contract-driven solutions: introduce adapters, interface shims, or capability
        probes that normalize collaborator inputs/outputs so any substitute behaves
        consistently. Update call sites to depend on the shared contract, add light
        tests or documentation as needed, and describe how the refactor improves
        substitution safety.
