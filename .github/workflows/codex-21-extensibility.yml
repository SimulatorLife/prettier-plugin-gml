      prompt: >
        Identify a single hard-coded decision point that limits flexibility. Refactor it
        into a configurable, parameterized, or hookable mechanism that preserves
        existing behavior by default while allowing for straightforward extension. Avoid
        overgeneralization: the change should solve one concrete extensibility gap
        without introducing unnecessary abstraction or complexity. Keep the
        implementation minimal, update any directly affected docs or inline comments,
        and ensure tests and linters still pass.
