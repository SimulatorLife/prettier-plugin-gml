        Target scope tracking, binding resolution, and project graph capabilities that unlock hot-reload coordination, with an explicit priority on speed, low overhead, and fast invalidation paths. Every change must be as performant or more performant than the previous state, avoiding added complexity that increases analysis time, memory usage, or graph churn.
        Focus on incremental wins such as faster invalidation, more efficient symbol metadata, or lean occurrence exports, and avoid feature expansion that does not directly improve reload latency or correctness. Prefer designs that reuse or delegate to existing compiler, runtime, or platform mechanisms rather than introducing parallel systems.
        Pair each change with focused, low-cost tests that validate hot-reload behavior without significantly increasing test execution time or maintenance burden.
