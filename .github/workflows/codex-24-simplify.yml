      prompt: |
        Locate a single block, function, or file whose implementation is noticeably over-engineered: bespoke helpers,
        verbose control flow, redundant state tracking, or other non-Pythonic patterns that obscure the intent. Refactor
        that one target into a concise, idiomatic solution that keeps behaviour intact while improving readability and
        maintainability. Avoid sweeping rewrites—focus on the clumsiest area you can make elegant without touching
        unrelated code. Make sure tests still pass and explain the original issues and the leaner approach in the commit
        message.
