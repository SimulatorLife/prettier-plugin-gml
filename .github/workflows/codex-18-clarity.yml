      prompt: >
        Locate a bite-sized logic path (function, reducer, effect handler, or small
        module) where the control flow is harder to read than it needs to be, and
        streamline it without changing behaviour. Favour guard clauses, early returns,
        or extracted helpers to flatten nesting, eliminate duplicated branches, and make
        intent immediately obvious. Keep naming/formatting tweaks to the style workflow;
        here the mission is to untangle logic so future contributors can follow it at a
        glance. Ship one concrete improvement, keep the diff minimal and well-tested,
        and note the before/after reasoning in the commit message so reviewers see the
        clarity win.
