      prompt: >
        Identify code that reimplements behaviour already provided by a shared helper or
        well-supported platform API (serialization, cloning, range checks, deep merges,
        randomization, etc.). Refactor the chosen spot to use the established helper or a
        modern built-in, removing the bespoke implementation while preserving behaviour
        and performance expectations. Adjust imports/exports as needed, add concise tests
        if the helper path is under-covered, and explain the before/after in the commit
        message so the rationale is obvious.
