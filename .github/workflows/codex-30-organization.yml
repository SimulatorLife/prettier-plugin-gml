      pr_body: "Seed PR for Codex to relocate one function, module, or asset to a more coherent home and tidy references."
      prompt: >
        Perform a focused organization pass. Locate one function, module, or file/asset that
        currently lives in an ill-fitting directory or file (e.g., UI helper in core
        logic, event utilities outside `src/events`, math helpers outside `src/math`).
        Justify why the current placement is suboptimal, then move it to the more
        logical location.

        Requirements:
          • Update all imports/exports so the project builds and tests still pass.
          • Maintain architectural boundaries—keep simulation logic, UI, grid, and shared
            utilities separated.
          • When moving code, ensure barrel files/index exports remain consistent, update
            documentation and comments referencing the old location, and adjust tests or
            fixtures.
          • Include a short summary in the commit message explaining the original location, the
            new location, and the rationale.
          • If no valid candidate is found, document why in the commit message and propose a
            future reorganization plan rather than submitting a no-op PR.

        Avoid pure renames with no location change, avoid wide-scope refactors, and do
        not introduce new dependencies. Keep the change narrowly focused but complete for
        the chosen item.
