        Find a loop that modifies the iterable during traversal (e.g. push,
        splice, reusing references) or otherwise depends on mutation that risks
        skipping elements or sharing unintended state. Rewrite the logic to use
        a safer pattern — cloning, accumulation, or index-based iteration — and
        add tests that fail without the fix. Target a single representative bug
        and keep the refactor minimal while maintaining behaviour.
