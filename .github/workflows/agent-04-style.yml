        Pick a focused area (module, component, helper, or small file cluster) where
        mechanical style has drifted—think indentation, spacing, casing, import/order
        conventions, filename alignment, or mismatched naming patterns—and bring it back
        to project standards. Normalize identifiers, comment tone/format, file headers, 
        etc. to match established conventions, and lean on tools like Prettier/ESLint 
        settings where possible/applicable. Avoid touching control flow or behavioural 
        logic; those tweaks live in a separate workflow. Always ship at least one 
        tangible correction, keep the diff small and reviewable, and ensure 
        linters and tests still pass after the tidy-up.
