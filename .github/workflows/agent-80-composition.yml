        Locate the class that most egregiously subclasses another type (uses `extends`)
        while overriding at least three methods from the parent. Study the inheritance
        chain and determine whether those overrides are handling distinct concerns or
        conditional branches that would be better served by composing helper objects or
        mixins. Refactor the chosen class to delegate behaviour to injected
        collaborators, mixin utilities, or other composition-friendly structures instead
        of deepening the subclass. Keep the public API and observable behaviour
        identical, trim any now-unused overrides, update tests and docs if directly
        impacted, and verify formatters and linters succeed.
