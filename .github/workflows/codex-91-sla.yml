      prompt: >
        Audit the codebase for a function that orchestrates high-level behaviour (controllers,
        command handlers, or other entry points) yet still mutates raw arrays, indexes into
        collections, or performs other primitive bookkeeping inline. Extract that low-level work
        into focused helpers so the orchestrator reads as a sequence of delegation steps at a single
        abstraction layer. Preserve behaviour, keep the diff tight, and ensure any new helper
        contracts are documented or tested as appropriate.
