        Codex, please audit the codebase for oversized functions whose names
        combine multiple verbs. Suggest helper extractions that reinforce the
        single-responsibility principle so that follow-up changes only need to
        touch one focused unit.

        Share a short before/after summary in the PR description and note any
        areas that still require human follow-up.
      prompt: >
        Run a repository-wide guardrail pass to enforce the single-responsibility
        principle. Identify one function whose body is extremely long
        (not including comments and blank lines) and whose name clearly strings 
        together multiple verb stems.
        Explain why the current implementation violates SRP, then propose and
        implement/reuse helper extraction(s) so that each resulting function owns a
        single change-triggering responsibility. Keep public APIs stable,
        preserve tests, and update documentation if behaviour shifts. If no
        candidate qualifies, document the audit findings and outline a follow-up
        plan instead of forcing changes.
