      prompt: >
        Search the repository for property chains longer than three segments (for example,
        patterns like `alpha.beta.gamma.delta`). Highlight the exact lines you choose in your
        summary so reviewers can see the high-risk chains that motivated the work. Refactor the
        most compelling instance by introducing intermediate helpers, facades, or other seams so
        collaborators only talk to their immediate neighbours. Keep the fix tightly scoped,
        document any new helper surfaces, and make sure existing tests still pass.
