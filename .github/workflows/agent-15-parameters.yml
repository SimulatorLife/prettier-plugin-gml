        Search for hardcoded constants or magic numbers that should be configurable.
        If there are enough to justify it, move them into a dedicated constants file.
        Refactor at least one meaningful value into a configurable parameter and
        integrate it cleanly with existing systems. The change must address a real
        extensibility or tuning limitation while avoiding unnecessary abstraction or
        added complexity.
