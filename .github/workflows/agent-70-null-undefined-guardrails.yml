        Locate a concrete instance where unchecked property access, missing
        optional chaining, or implicit assumptions about non-null values can
        throw `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined/null`. Implement
        a focused fix, such as early returns, guard clauses, or optional
        chaining, together with regression coverage demonstrating the failure
        before and the guarded behaviour after. Keep the update minimal —
        address just one high-impact nullability hazard while preserving the
        existing API surface.
