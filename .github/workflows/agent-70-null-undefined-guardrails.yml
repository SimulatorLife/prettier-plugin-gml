      pr_body: >
        Seed PR for Agent to tighten defensive programming around nullable
        values by adding targeted null/undefined guards where they are missing.
      prompt: >
        Locate a concrete instance where unchecked property access, missing
        optional chaining, or implicit assumptions about non-null values can
        throw `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined/null`. Implement
        a focused fix, such as early returns, guard clauses, or optional
        chaining, together with regression coverage demonstrating the failure
        before and the guarded behaviour after. Keep the update minimal —
        address just one high-impact nullability hazard while preserving the
        existing API surface.
