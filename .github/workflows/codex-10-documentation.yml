        Focus on the project's primary documentation surfaces—README, docs/ guides,
        CHANGELOG entries, onboarding notes, and any top-level usage instructions—to
        ensure they accurately reflect the current architecture, features, and
        contributor workflow. Tighten quick-start steps, configuration references, and
        narrative explanations so new contributors and curious players can ramp up
        without wading through stale details. Expand or prune sections only where doing
        so improves accuracy, remove outdated callouts, and cross-link related guides
        when it boosts discoverability. Leave inline comments, docstrings, and API
        reference tidy-ups to their dedicated workflow. Keep edits practical, concise,
        and easy to review so the documentation remains welcoming and trustworthy.
