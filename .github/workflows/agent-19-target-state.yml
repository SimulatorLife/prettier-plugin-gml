        Review the architectural guidelines defined in `docs/target-state.md` and identify
        a single, targeted area of the codebase that currently violates these boundaries
        or contracts. This could involve migrating a semantic rewrite out of the formatter
        (`@gml-modules/plugin`) and into the linter (`@gml-modules/lint`), moving
        project-aware functionality into the refactor workspace (`@gml-modules/refactor`),
        or enforcing the two-tier malformed code strategy. Make a precise, well-tested
        change to align the code with the target state. Keep the diff minimal and focused
        on a single architectural correction. Explain the specific boundary or contract
        being enforced in the commit message.
