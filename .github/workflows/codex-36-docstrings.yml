      prompt: >
        Concentrate on inline documentation—JSDoc blocks, function/module comments,
        README-style API tables embedded in source, and other code-adjacent explanations.
        Pick one focused area and make the guidance timely, precise, and easy to skim.
        Clarify parameters and return types, describe edge cases or invariants, remove
        stale notes, and add short “why it matters” context where behaviour is subtle.
        Avoid broad narrative docs (handled in the core documentation workflow) and keep
        formatting consistent with existing comment style. Deliver at least one tangible
        improvement while keeping the code itself behaviourally unchanged and the diff
        compact.
