      prompt: >
        Concentrate on inline documentation—JSDoc blocks, function/module comments,
        README-style API tables embedded in source, and other code-adjacent explanations.
        Pick one focused area and make the guidance timely, precise, and easy to skim.
        Clarify parameters and return types, describe edge cases or invariants, remove
        stale notes, add a new docstring to a function, or add short “why it matters” 
        context where behaviour is subtle. Avoid broad narrative docs; focus on in-code
        comments and docstrings. Keep the formatting consistent with existing comment 
        style. Deliver at least one tangible improvement while keeping the code itself 
        behaviourally unchanged and the diff compact.
