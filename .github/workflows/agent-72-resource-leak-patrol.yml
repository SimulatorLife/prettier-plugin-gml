        Identify one hot path where resources (file descriptors, sockets,
        timers, observers) are created but not reliably disposed. Introduce the
        minimal fix — finally blocks, AbortController, teardown helpers — that
        guarantees cleanup even on error, and add an automated test or
        diagnostic that reproduces the leak without the change. Keep the scope
        tight: fix one leak thoroughly and document any follow-up considerations
        if broader work remains.
