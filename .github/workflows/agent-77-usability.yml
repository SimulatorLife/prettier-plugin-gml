        Identify one meaningful entrypoint—CLI command, npm script, executable, or other
        runnable task—that a typical contributor or user would run during day-to-day
        work. Execute it end-to-end and capture how approachable and informative the
        experience feels, focusing on clear help text, obvious success/failure signals,
        actionable errors, and consistent messaging with related tooling. Prioritize
        uncovering gaps such as missing usage guidance, confusing defaults, inconsistent
        flags between similar commands, or opaque output. Pick exactly one improvement
        that resolves the most painful usability issue you find, implement that change,
        and update any accompanying docs or examples needed to lock in the better
        experience. Keep the fix self-contained and focused on delivering that improved
        experience.
