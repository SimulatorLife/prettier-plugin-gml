      pr_body: >
        Seed PR for Codex to replace an unsafe floating-point equality check
        with a tolerance-aware comparison backed by tests.
      prompt: >
        Find code comparing non-integer numbers using strict equality or
        inequality that can fail due to rounding error. Replace it with a
        tolerance-aware helper (epsilon comparison) or another numerically
        stable approach, and add regression coverage that would flake without
        the fix. Keep the change surgical by targeting one real-world check
        where the precision bug is plausibly triggered.
