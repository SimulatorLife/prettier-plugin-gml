        Focus on developing the CLI for the hot reload pipeline—watch mode coordination, transpiler,
        semantic refreshes, refactor triggers, and runtime wrapper patch streaming. Prefer
        small, end-to-end improvements with strong tests and documentation updates where the
        commands evolve.
